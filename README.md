# Bazinga-2022-2023

Before Nov, 12, 2022  - Had a lot of problems / Focused on building the robot first
              - Teleop would not load onto the Control Hub
                - Fixed by upgrading Gradle
              - Had to run with LinearOpmode
              - Object nullpoint error
                - Fixed this by deleting LinearOpmode and using Opmode
                
Nov 12, 2022  - Teleop with Opmode (not LinearOpmode) test successful
              - Imported temporary autonomous into folder
              - Almost ready to try to program RoadRunner
